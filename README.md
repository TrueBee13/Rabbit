# Rabbit
We have a very lonely rabbit in a zoo. To entertain him we put N hight staircase in his cage. So now to satisfy  our curiosity we want to count how many ways he has to reach the top from the bottom. Evry time he van do M jumps. Sound like fun Fibonacci puzzle.

ways(n, m) = ways(n-1, m) + ways(n-2, m) + ... ways(n-m, m)
