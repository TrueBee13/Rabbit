# Rabbit

We have a very lonely rabbit in a zoo. To entertain him we put N hight staircase in his cage. So now to satisfy  our curiosity we want to count how many ways he has to reach the top from the bottom. Evry time he van do M jumps. Sound like fun Fibonacci puzzle.

ways(n, m) = ways(n-1, m) + ways(n-2, m) + ... ways(n-m, m)

Installation
I have used Vim text editor to write a program and compile it on python3 (for a file with extension ".py") or GCC compiler.( for file with the extension ".c")

Clone repo: git clone
Open project in vim
Follow the instructions on a screen. Remember to be realistic and do not make my rabbit to jump to high!
